A quickly assembled Python script and module to solve a weekly word puzzle quickly.

The puzzle was to find an 11 letter word that, when two "d's" were removed, became a country capital followed by a zodiac sign.

The solution was to just test every possible solution from world capitals that did not contain special characters and a number of the zodiac signs that seemed like possible "suffixes."

The solution speed is under 1 second on an old MacOS laptop.
