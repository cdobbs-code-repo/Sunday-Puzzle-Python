The problem for this week was as follows:

Name a person with a certain kind of disorder.
Drop the first two letters and the last letter of the word, and you'll name a country.
What is it?

The solution was to
1. iterate through a dictionary
2. drop the first two letters and the last letter of the word
3. check this new word against every country
4. print out any matches

The solution came out as "pyromaniac."

The program execution time took about 2.65 seconds.
