# Sunday-Puzzle-Python
These are various scripts I wrote and write to solve weekly word puzzles for Will Shortz's Sunday Puzzle.
Solving these puzzles serves the purpose of allowing me to try and gradually improve Python scripting by trying new libraries, organizing my code better, and adding better comments (sometimes- noting this is just for practice).
