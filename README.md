# Sunday-Puzzle-Python
These are various scripts I write to solve weekly word puzzles for Will Shortz's Sunday Puzzle. I enjoy finding ways to let my computer do all the hard work.
## General Guide
### 05_06_2018
just dictionary text document iteration
### 06_28_2020_NLTK_hypernyms
using hypernyms with **NLTK** to categorize words
### 07_14_2019
just collecting country capital list and then puzzle solving
### 07_28_2019

### 08_23_2020
dictionary text document iteration, a tricky solving method function
### 09_04_2016

copy pasted wiki page of "C authors" into excel, then copied column I wanted from excel to a text file, then preprocessed and iterated through to find answer
