This is just a quick script I wrote to solve the Sunday Puzzle on 7/28/19. The puzzle involved finding a 6 letter word associated with magic where the word was "balanced." An example "balanced" word is BEVY becaust B is 2 letters from the beginning of the alphabet and Y is 2 letters from the end, and, similarly, E is 5 letters from the beginning whereas V is 5 letters from the end.
